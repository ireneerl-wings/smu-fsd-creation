Based on my analysis of this SAP Functional Specification Document for the "Auto Delete Reservation" enhancement, here are the extracted requirements organized by category:

## **System Requirements**

### **Functional Requirements**
- **Object ID**: B0141 - Auto Delete Reservation enhancement for SAP system
- **Stream Area**: Production Planning module
- **Complexity Level**: Low complexity enhancement
- **Primary Function**: Automatically delete material reservations based on configurable residence time through scheduled jobs
- **Execution Method**: Custom Transaction Code (TBC - To Be Confirmed)

### **Core Business Functions**
- Create and maintain master data for reservation deletion parameters (Material Type, Plant, Storage Location, Movement Type, Residence Time)
- Execute scheduled job to automatically delete reservations older than configured residence time
- Validate reservation status before deletion (check for open deliveries, final issue status, deletion flags)
- Update reservation status to 'Expired' when applicable

## **Interfaces / Integrations**

### **SAP Standard Tables Integration**
- **T158B**: Movement Type validation for transaction code 'MB21' (Create Reservation)
- **T134**: Material Types validation
- **I_ReservationDocumentHeader**: Reservation header data access
- **I_ReservationDocumentItem**: Reservation line item data access
- **I_Product**: Product/Material master data access
- **I_DeliveryDocumentItem**: Delivery document item validation
- **I_DeliveryDocument**: Delivery document header validation
- **STVARV**: System variables for reservation closed status (ZMM_RSV_CLSD_STATUS)

### **Custom Tables**
- **ZPPT_DEL_RESV**: Master data source for deletion parameters
- **ZMMT_M_RSVREQ_AA**: Master Setting for Auto Close Reservation Job
- **ZMMT_T_RSVREQ_H**: Reservation Request Header table

### **API Integration**
- **I_RESERVATIONDOCUMENTTP-UPDATE**: SAP API for updating reservation documents (Final Issue Flag and Deletion Flag)

## **Data Structures**

### **Input Data Structures**

#### **Master Setting Table (ZMMT_M_RSVREQ_AA)**
- **Movement Type** (BWART): CHAR(3), Mandatory, validated against T158B with TCODE='MB21'
- **Material Type** (MTART): CHAR(4), Mandatory, validated against T134
- **Days**: NUMC(3), Mandatory, numeric value 0-999, represents residence time
- **Audit Fields**: Include structure ZZXS_CHLOG for change logging

#### **Job Execution Parameters**
- **Reservation**: NUMC(10), Optional, validated against I_ReservationDocumentHeader
- **Requirement Date**: CHAR(4), Mandatory if Reservation blank, default = Today's Date
- **Movement Type**: CHAR(3), Optional, validated against master setting table
- **Plant**: CHAR(4), Optional, subject to authorization validation

### **Output Data Structures**

#### **Success Messages**
- Record creation: "Record was created successfully"
- Record update: "Record was updated successfully" 
- Record deletion: "Record was deleted successfully"

#### **Error Messages**
- Duplicate data: "Record with the same key already exists"
- Invalid movement type: "Movement Type [X] not maintained in Master Setting Job Auto Close, check your input"

#### **Processing Results**
- Updated reservation status to 'EX' (Expired) in ZMMT_T_RSVREQ_H
- Final Issue Flag set to 'X' for completed deliveries
- Deletion Flag set to 'X' for reservations without open deliveries

## **Process and Workflow Steps**

### **Master Data Maintenance Workflow**
1. **Create Mode**: Input Movement Type (browse from T158B), Material Type (browse from T134), Days (numeric input)
2. **Update Mode**: Movement Type and Material Type are read-only, only Days field editable
3. **Delete Mode**: Select row and click delete button, row becomes hidden from display

### **Auto Deletion Job Workflow**
1. **Parameter Validation**: Validate input parameters against master setting table and authorization
2. **Reservation Selection**: Query reservations based on requirement date, movement type, plant filters
3. **Status Validation**: Check deletion flag, final issue flag, and reservation status
4. **Delivery Check**: Validate if delivery documents exist and their completion status
5. **Action Execution**: 
   - If delivery completed: Set Final Issue Flag
   - If no open delivery: Set Deletion Flag
   - Update reservation request status to 'Expired'

### **Selection Logic**
- Select reservations where Requirement Date < (Entered Date - Days from Master Setting)
- Filter by Status IN STVARV-ZMM_RSV_CLSD_STATUS
- Exclude reservations with Deletion Flag = 'X' or Final Issue = 'X'
- Apply Movement Type and Plant filters if specified

## **Test Scenarios / Validation Criteria**

### **Positive Test Cases**
1. **Master Data Creation**: Successfully create new record without duplication
2. **Master Data Update**: Successfully change Days field without causing duplication
3. **Master Data Deletion**: Successfully delete selected record
4. **Job Execution**: Successfully process reservations without open deliveries
5. **Authorization**: Valid user with proper authorization can execute functions

### **Negative Test Cases**
1. **Duplicate Prevention**: Prevent creation of records with same Movement Type + Material Type combination
2. **Duplication on Update**: Prevent updates that would create duplicate keys
3. **Invalid Movement Type**: Reject movement types not maintained in master setting
4. **Open Delivery Handling**: Skip reservations with incomplete deliveries
5. **Authorization Failure**: Reject unauthorized access attempts

## **Security Requirements**

### **Authorization Objects**
- **M_MRES_BWA**: Authorization for Reservations
  - **ACTVT**: Activity field (06 = Delete permission required)
  - **BWART**: Movement Type authorization (e.g., 201, 261, 311)
  - **WERKS**: Plant authorization

### **Authorization Validation Points**
- Movement Type entry validation against user's authorized movement types
- Plant field validation against user's authorized plants
- Delete activity authorization check before reservation deletion

## **Performance, Scalability, Reliability Requirements**

### **Scheduling Requirements**
- **Execution Frequency**: Daily execution at 4:00 AM
- **Load Characteristics**: Possibility to process multiple reservation deletions simultaneously
- **Job Dependencies**: Master data must be maintained before job execution

### **System Load Considerations**
- Enhancement designed for daily batch processing
- Anticipated to handle multiple concurrent deletion operations
- Scheduled during low-activity hours to minimize system impact

## **Error Handling and Exception Flows**

### **Validation Errors**
- **Duplicate Key Error**: Prevent duplicate Movement Type + Material Type combinations
- **Invalid Movement Type**: Validate against T158B with TCODE='MB21'
- **Invalid Material Type**: Validate against T134 table
- **Numeric Validation**: Ensure Days field contains valid numeric values (0-999)

### **Processing Exceptions**
- **Open Delivery Skip**: Skip reservations with incomplete deliveries (OverallGoodsMovementStatus â‰  'C')
- **Authorization Failure**: Block unauthorized access with appropriate error messages
- **Missing Master Data**: Validate master data existence before job execution

## **Dependencies and Constraints**

### **Development Dependencies**
- Master Data TCODE must be built before creating auto delete job
- Custom table ZMMT_M_RSVREQ_AA must be created with audit structure ZZXS_CHLOG

### **Execution Dependencies**
- Master data must be maintained in ZPPT_DEL_RESV before job execution
- Job frequency and parameters must be defined before scheduling
- Authorization objects must be properly configured

### **Business Process Dependencies**
- **Impacted Sub-Process**: B-020-010 Material Staging Process
- **Process Flow Reference**: https://app-sgp.signavio.com/p/hub/model/eccdbcffddcc47c39e582b690cda8b90
- Integration with production planning workflow including Trial Production, Production Schedule Review, and various Stock Transfer scenarios

### **Assumptions and Risks**
- **Assumption**: Auto Delete Reservation executed by scheduled job based on master data configuration
- **Risk**: Inability to perform auto delete reservation functionality
- **Mitigation**: Proper master data maintenance and job parameter configuration required
